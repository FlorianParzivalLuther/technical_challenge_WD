The Phone Cave App
The Phone Cave app is a catalog showcasing a variety of phones available at The Phone Cave store. The app consists of a REST API server built with Node.js and Express, serving data from a phones.json file, and a React frontend that communicates with the API to display the phone catalog and their details.

Step 1: Set up the Server
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Start the server by running npm start.
The server will be running on http://localhost:5000.
Step 2: Set up the Client
Navigate to the client directory in your terminal.

Click on any phone model in the list to view its detailed information, including the name, manufacturer, description, color, price, screen size, processor, RAM, and an image of the device.
Loading Indicator
While the app is fetching data from the server, you will see a "Loading..." message to indicate that the data is being retrieved.

API Endpoints
The server provides the following API endpoints:

/phones - GET request to fetch all phones from the phones.json file as fake data.
/phones/:id - GET request to fetch details of a specific phone by its ID.
